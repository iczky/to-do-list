# To-Do-List
This is a To-Do-List app that currently is built with Express and Ejs.

My goals are to make a full-blown app To-Do-List that will use:

 1. React
 2. Implement Database
 3. Implement Role Based Access Control

Currently this web app just serves as note taking for to do list, and also user is able to exclude if the list is already completed.

To try and use this project, you can:

    git clone

In the working directory, run init to install the package:

    npm i -y

After that, run index.js to deploy the local server:

    node index.js
    
    //if you have nodemon
    nodemon index.js
